# searchRestaurants
This is my first project using React-native and Yelp api to search restaurants with their ratings, reviews and budget. Special thanks to Stephen Grider.

After cloning, run npm-install into the root and install axios.

Then go to yelp.com, create your app and get your token and paste it into api/yelp.js.
